    description: "This project was submitted for HackED 2021, with Akrash Sharma, Abeer Waheed, and David Parise. Due to the pandemic, we created a site that allows students to submit their discord handles and courses so that they can connect with students with similar courses as normal and so keeping the classroom socialization aspect that many students missed about in-person learning ongoing. I was involved across the stack",

    description:"This package was inspired by Stats 265. As we went through the course we learned lots of distributions. I then decided to make a package capable of playing around with all the distributions, (visualisations showing models, how accurately those model estimates given data and calculating statistics of data e.g mean, standard deviation, etc). Currently, it offers 28% of the distributions we learnt.",

      title: 'Stem Big data challenge',
      description: "Inspired by the Covid-19 pandemic, which was at the time yet to really unfold in Africa. Akrash Sharma,Xhiang Zhang, and I decided to investigate the correlation between flights and covid cases in these African countries. We figured that there should be a decent correlation by observing that the two most plagued countries at the time were SA and Egypt(the two most busy countries airwise). We were pleased with the results as the linear regressions yielded some strong correlations (R-squared 95%+)",
