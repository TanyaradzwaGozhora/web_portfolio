Due to the pandemic, we created a site that allows students to submit their discord handles and courses so that they can connect with students with similar courses as normal and so keeping the classroom socialization aspect that many students missed about in-person learning ongoing.",

    description:"This package was inspired by Stats 265. As we went through the course we learned lots of distributions. I then decided to make a package capable of playing around with all the distributions, (visualisations showing models, how accurately those model estimates given data and calculating statistics of data e.g mean, standard deviation, etc). Currently, it offers 28% of the distributions we learnt.",

      description: "Inspired by the Covid-19 pandemic, which was at the time yet to really unfold in Africa. Akrash Sharma, Xhiang Zhang, and I decided to investigate the correlation between flights and covid cases in these African countries. We figured that there should be a decent correlation by observing that the two most affected countries at the time were South Africa and Egypt, the major air traffic centers on the continent. We were pleased with the results as the linear regressions yielded some strong correlations with an R-squared 95%+",
